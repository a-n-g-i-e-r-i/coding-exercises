# Write a function named append_sum that has one parameter â€” a list named named lst.

# The function should add the last two elements of lst together and append the result to lst. It should do this process three times and then return lst.

# For example, if lst started as [1, 1, 2], the final result should be [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8].

def append_sum(lst):
  [lst.append(sum(list(lst[-2:]))) for _ in range(3)]
  return lst

print(append_sum([1, 1, 2]))
